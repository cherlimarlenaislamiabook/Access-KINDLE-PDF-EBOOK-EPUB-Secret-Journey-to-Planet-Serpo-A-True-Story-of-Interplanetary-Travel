Secret Journey to Planet Serpo: A True Story of Interplanetary Travel by Len Kasten Book Review

Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Best UFO Book Very Authorative and Credible
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2018
Review: This is the best UFO book I have ever read. The source material is authentic and extremely credible. When Ben Rich, the father of the Stealth Fighter Jet died, his death bed confession was "the U.S. military has been to the stars" and "it doesn't take a lifetime". He was referring to Project Serpo. Author Len Kasten has done his homework and this book is a truly timeless classic.

Title: Baby, This Ain't Star Trek
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018
Review: Ever watch Star Trek and think you'd like to travel around to other planets, too? Secret Journey to Planet Serpo is the supposedly true tale of some pioneers who did just that. Not surprisingly, it begins with the crash at Roswell and it has all been kept (if true) from the American public who funded the venture with their tax dollars. Why? Paranoid leaders who claim we can't deal with the truth when, in fact, they simply won't give up ANY of their power derived from secrets kept.

I suspect this tale may be true, if censored a little here and there. This is largely a story of Americans who succeeded through massive amounts of hard work and grit. First, we humans had to figure out how to contact the Zeta Reticulans (ZT) using their communication device salvaged from the crashed craft. Then, huge language barriers had to be overcome in communicating with the stranded ZT and his home world.

After overcoming seemingly enormous communication challenges, a team of humans is assembled and equipped to travel to Serpo, the home world of the ZT's, for a decade. So, what's it like to travel through a wormhole? Lots of nausea, confusion, and dizziness with no view whatsoever out the porthole. Think you might see stars whizzing by like on Star Trek? Hah! Sign language rules the day. Pointing at the chair means, "Get back in your chair."

Landing upon Serpo they find a people, culture, and planet that is strange but not that strange. At that time the population of the planet is only around 600,000. They reproduce in a manner similar to humans, but a military oligarchy style of leadership limits families to two children. The population tolerates the military rule as the result of a recent and traumatizing 100 year war. The ZT's enjoy dancing and games as we do. They have strange plants and animals, some of which the Americans are able to consume. Otherwise the food is pretty tasteless. The water tastes strange and has to be boiled. Eventually, while mapping the planet, the group finds an area very similar to Montana with mountains and trees and they remain here for the remainder of their journey.

Figuring out how much time has passed is one of the biggest challenges and the group winds up staying 13 years rather than 10. As with people who love others and love to travel, two of the group fall in love with Serpo and her people and decide to stay. Most return to Earth. Some pass away on the journey or on Serpo. The military oligarchy that rules THIS planet must have declassified the story which I believe to be true, but they have withheld the photos taken.

All in all, I kind of wound up liking the Zeta Reticulans from a distance. They seem like normal, cordial folks. American literature has been pretty full of scary accounts of the ZT's abducting humans and those stories may be true but I now suspect those abductions may have been carried out by military leaders who are arguably always pretty scary. For the reader interested in anthropology, the one major cultural gaffe which occurred during the journey was the harvesting of body parts and tissues from a crew member that unexpectedly died. I'm surprised the human censors allowed this to get through because it's a huge hint for those who connect the dots. Somehow, everyone managed to smooth this over and move on.

Title: Read this.!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2019
Review: You may chuckle...don't. The most interesting part, for me (a silly statement), is the problem they had trying to keep track of time. On earth, UCLA put a cesium clock in a canyon and another on a mountain. The difference was significant in 24Hr. Serpo is at ZR2 and as it moves around that binary, the gravity influence changes. Some of the orbit it's between the two stars and then it's on the far end of two. Read how Carl Sagan felt about that. One thing, this book is not a Novel. It is a research book. All info is arranged, explained, and has in-depth pre-&-post history as well as diary entries and daily reports. Mine has about twenty book-marks and I keep using it. Another great section is about a partly-humanoid individual that they saw in the meal-eating building. None of the Ebens seemed to pay him any attention. That means different civilizations are collaborating and it appeared to be normal on that planet. Do this, tell yourself it's a plot for a really good Sci-Fi movie and memorize it in case someone ask about it.

Title: EXCELLENT READ!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2020
Review: I have to say that I have been into the UFO/Ancient Astronaut phenomenon for nearly 40 years. I have read all the books, seen the TV shows, and have worked as an Assistant Art Director in NYC on one of the premier UFO magazines in the late 80's. During that time with the publication I have seen some unusual stories sent to us with no return addresses. Some of stuff that could not possibly be real, but you never know? And as the years pass, some of it was coming to light. Now we get this excellent book written with all the fluency of one that has done intense research. Each chapter up to the Planet Serpo saga could be worthy of a book itself. This was a definitely fascinating page-turning-read, that to me, kinda filled in all the blank spots from the Roswell incident and literally takes you to another planet 38.5 light years away. If you are into UFO's, this well written (and never uninteresting) book is LOADED with information that will keep you satisfied while making you want more. The author has more books that are just as great! But this one should be put first on the read list.
